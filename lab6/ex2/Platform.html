                <p>The S5 shipped with Android 4.4.2 KitKat but has received updates to currently up to 6.0.1 Marshmallow).
                    It has Samsung's TouchWiz software, which for the S5 has a flatter, more geometric look than that found
                    on the S4. Certain aspects of the changes were influenced by a recent patent licensing deal with Google,
                    which requires that Samsung's TouchWiz interface follow the design of "stock" Android more closely. The
                    S5 adds the Galaxy Note 3's "My Magazine" feature to the leftmost page on the home screen, the Settings
                    menu was updated with a new grid-based layout, a Kids' Mode was added, while the S Health app was given
                    expanded functionality, integrating with the new heart rate sensor on the device, along with the new
                    Gear 2 smartwatch and Gear Fit activity tracker. The "Download Booster" tool allows internet usage to
                    be split across LTE and Wi-Fi to improve download speed. Due to carrier policies, Download Booster was
                    not available on Galaxy S5 models released in the United States running KitKat 4.4.2, excluding T-Mobile
                    US and U.S. Cellular. (Source Wikipedia)
